## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   `npm` or `yarn` or `pnpm`

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd fintrack-flow
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
        *(Note: If `.env.example` doesn't exist, create `.env` manually based on the required variables below).*
    *   You will need to populate this file with your Firebase project credentials and any necessary API keys for Google AI (Genkit).

    **Required `.env` variables:**
    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID

    # Google AI API Key (for Genkit if using Google AI models)
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
    ```

4.  **Firebase Project Setup:**
    *   Create a project on [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Add a Web app to your Firebase project and copy the configuration details into your `.env` file.
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Go to the "Authentication" section, then "Sign-in method" tab. Enable "Email/Password" and "Google" providers. Make sure to add `localhost` to the list of "Authorized domains" for Google Sign-In to work during local development.
    *   **Enable Firestore:** Go to the "Firestore Database" section and create a database. Start in **test mode** for initial development (allows all reads/writes) or immediately set up security rules.
    *   **Firestore Security Rules:** For proper data security, configure Firestore security rules to ensure users can only access their own data. An example:
        ```json
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Match any collection where documents have a 'userId' field
            match /{collection}/{docId} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
              allow create: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
        *Replace `/{collection}/{docId}` with specific rules for your `transactions`, `budgets`, and `goals` collections for more fine-grained control.*

5.  **Genkit (Google AI) Setup:**
    *   If you are using Google AI models with Genkit (like Gemini), ensure you have an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and have enabled the necessary APIs in your Google Cloud project. Add this key to your `.env` file as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

6.  **Run the development server:**
    The `dev` script uses `concurrently` to start both the Next.js app and the Genkit development server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *   The Next.js application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
    *   The Genkit server (and its Dev UI) will typically be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

    Check your terminal output for the exact ports.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode with Next.js and Genkit servers.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the production server (after building).
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Checks for TypeScript errors.
*   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts only the Genkit development server.
